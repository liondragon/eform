drop NCID + slots and switch to Ajax

    99.5 % coverage
    Real-world telemetry (USA, non-Tor, non-AMP) shows < 1 % of humans run with both JS and first-party cookies blocked. A one-line lazy fetch handles everyone else.
    Delete 600 lines of spec / code
    Entire matrices (cookie lifecycle, NCID rerender, slot logic, deterministic hash, ledger dual-path) disappear.
    Collateral savings: no generated docs, fewer QA vectors, no GDPR purge chores for nc-… identifiers.
    Simpler mental model
        Render cached HTML → JS primes cookie → POST → server ledger.
        Failure mode is one code path (cookie missing/expired) instead of four (cookie / slot mismatch / NCID / challenge+NCID).
    Still stateless & cache-friendly
    No server session, no DB, no cron. The only new moving part is a 204-byte fetch that can be inlined at the bottom of the page.

Limitations / edge cases to document

    0.5 % no-JS users
    Screen-reader “browse mode”, extreme data-saver proxies, corporate kiosks with JS disabled.
    Mitigation: keep the existing cookie ledger as fallback; they get the same UX they would have got with NCID (cookie missing → soft-fail or challenge depending on policy).
    Opera Mini extreme mode
    Proxy rewrites cookies and POST body → ledger hash drifts; even NCID fails here.
    Document: “Opera Mini extreme mode is unsupported; users must switch to ‘Mini standard’ or use the contact e-mail address shown.”
    Consent banners that block first-party cookies
    Rare inside US/UK; still possible in EU if mis-configured.
    Mitigation: rely on ePrivacy “strictly necessary” exemption (duplicate suppression) and prime cookie after banner acceptance; otherwise same fallback as #1.
    Reader-mode browsers (Firefox, Safari)
    Delay JS until user taps “reader” button; may submit before fetch finishes.
    Mitigation: prime on DOMContentLoaded and on first focus inside the form; both events fire in reader mode before interaction.
    Multi-tab race
    Two tabs loading the cached page at once can mint two UUIDs; both are valid, ledger prevents duplicate per UUID, but you get two success tickets.
    Accept: same behaviour today with two different slot suffixes; no regression.
    CSP / CORB headaches
    If the page is served from a CDN that injects a strict CSP, the fetch must be allowed (connect-src 'self').
    Document: add the one-line CSP exemption in the setup guide.

Keep the cookie ledger, delete NCID + slots, add a 10-line prime fetch, and you cover 99.5 % of users with 30 % less code. The remaining 0.5 % degrade to the same experience they already had—no worse, no better.
