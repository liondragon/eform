 28. KNOWN DEBT & OPTIMIZATIONS
 	(No outstanding debt items at this time.)

+<a id="sec-delivery"></a>
+29. DELIVERY ABSTRACTION (INTERNAL)
+
+**Rationale:** The delivery abstraction creates a single internal boundary for post-validation side effects. Today email is the only sink; the abstraction prepares a seam for future CRM integration without adding config surface or changing external behavior.
+
+### 29.1 delivery_id
+- A UUIDv4 generated at token mint time (both hidden-mode and `/eforms/mint`).
+- Persisted in the token record alongside `mode`, `form_id`, `instance_id`, `issued_at`, `expires`.
+- Purpose: log/audit correlation, submission tracing.
+- Not exposed to clients; internal only.
+- Each token mint generates a fresh `delivery_id`; it is NOT stable across remints.
+
+### 29.2 SubmissionPayload (internal)
+After normalize/validate/coerce succeeds, `SubmitHandler` constructs an immutable `SubmissionPayload`:
+```
+{ form_id, template_version, request_id, delivery_id, submission_id,
+  canonical_values, upload_metadata, meta }
+```
+- `request_id`: correlation from Logging.
+- `delivery_id`: from the validated token record.
+- `submission_id`: equals the posted `eforms_token`.
+- `canonical_values`: field_key → canonical value after coercion.
+- `upload_metadata`: array of `{ path, bytes, mime, sha256, original_name_safe }`.
+- `meta`: `{ submitted_at, ip_processed, origin_state }`.
+
+All downstream delivery sinks consume this object. Not serialized to clients.
+
+### 29.3 Delivery::deliver()
+Single internal boundary for post-validation side effects. Called after ledger reservation succeeds. Returns `DeliveryResult { delivered, sink, error_code? }`. Email is the only sink in v1.
+
+### 29.4 Extension hook
+`do_action('eforms_submission_payload', SubmissionPayload $payload)` fires read-only immediately before `Delivery::deliver()`. Listeners MUST NOT mutate the payload or perform write operations that affect submission success. Intended for logging, analytics, or prototyping external integrations.
+
+### 29.5 Future extension (non-normative)
+CRM delivery modes (`email`, `crm`, `both`) and provider configuration are deferred. When implemented, they will extend the template schema under `delivery.*` and add config keys under `delivery.crm.*`. A stable idempotency key for CRM deduplication across retries requires additional design (e.g., server-issued remint grants); see `docs/crm.md` for the design sketch.
