 18. CONFIGURATION: DOMAINS, CONSTRAINTS, AND DEFAULTS
 - Authority: Default *values* live in code as `Config::DEFAULTS` (see `src/Config.php`). This spec no longer duplicates every literal; the code array is the single source of truth for defaults.
 
+- Override sources (normative):
+	- Base defaults: `Config::DEFAULTS`.
+	- Optional drop-in override file: `${WP_CONTENT_DIR}/eforms.config.php` (typically `wp-content/eforms.config.php`) returning an array of overrides.
+	- Optional WordPress filter: `eforms_config` — receives the merged config array and returns the final config array.
+	- Precedence (normative): defaults < drop-in file < `eforms_config` filter.
+	- Bootstrap safety (normative): drop-in loading occurs only when `ABSPATH` and `WP_CONTENT_DIR` are defined; otherwise skip drop-in loading (standalone tooling MAY force bootstrap without WordPress loaded).
+	- Drop-in file contract (normative):
+		- MUST be side-effect free (no output).
+		- MUST NOT call `exit`/`die`.
+		- MUST `return` an array.
+	- Drop-in failure behavior (normative):
+		- Missing file: treat as an empty override (no-op).
+		- Unreadable file: treat as a configuration validation error and continue with defaults.
+		- Return value not an array: treat as a configuration validation error and continue with defaults.
+		- Warnings/notices/output during load: treat as a configuration validation error and continue with defaults.
+		- Syntax errors are PHP parse errors; operators MUST fix or remove the file to recover.
+		- Logging (normative): when `logging.mode != "off"` and `logging.level` includes warnings, configuration validation errors from drop-in loading MUST emit a warning with a deterministic code (`EFORMS_CONFIG_DROPIN_IO` or `EFORMS_CONFIG_DROPIN_INVALID`) and include { path, reason }.

 Defaults note: When this spec refers to a ‘Default’, the authoritative literal is `Config::DEFAULTS` in code; the spec does not restate those literals.
 	- Normative constraints (this spec): types, enums, required/forbidden combinations, range clamps, migration/fallback behavior, and precedence rules remain authoritative here. Implementations MUST enforce these even when defaults evolve.
-	- Lazy bootstrap: The first call to `Config::get()` (including the invocations performed by `FormRenderer::render()`, `SubmitHandler::handle()`, `Security::token_validate()`, `Emailer::send()`, or the prime/success endpoints) invokes `Config::bootstrap()`; within a request it runs at most once, applies the `eforms_config` filter, clamps values, then freezes the snapshot. `uninstall.php` calls it eagerly to honor purge flags; standalone tooling MAY force bootstrap.

 		- Entry points SHOULD call `Config::get()` before invoking helpers (see [Lazy-load Matrix](#sec-lazy-load-matrix) for trigger ownership).
 - Helpers MUST ALSO call `Config::get()` on first use as a safety net; the call is idempotent so callers that forget still behave correctly.
